Application Title:
 File Decryption

Purpose:
 To decrypt a text file

Program Procedures:
 Run the program

Algorithms, Processing, and Conditions:
0. User calls the program
1. Program imports the os module
2. Program defines the translation dictionary
3. Program checks to see if text1 exists and appends it to encrypt
4. Program calls encrypt_to_text with encrypt
    5. Program sets temp_text and text_string to an empty string and text_list to an empty list
    6. Program iterates over every line in encrypt as text
        7. Program iterates over every character in text as i
            8. Program iterates over the items in TRANSLATE_DICT as key and val
                9. Program checks if val is equal to i
                    9a. Program sets temp_text to key
                    9b. Program breaks out of the loop
            10. Program adds the value of temp_text to text_string
            11. Program sets temp_text to an empty string
        12. Program appends text_string to text_list
        13. Program sets temp_string to an empty string
    14. Program iterates over every character in text_list as i
        14a. Program prints every decrypted line

Notes and Restrictions:
 The file text1 must be encrypted with the File Encryption to work properly

Comments:
 File Encryption and File Decryption go together

USE CASE DEFINITION:
1. User calls the program
2. Program calls the text1 file
3. Program decrypts the data
4. Program displays the data to the user
5. Program finishes
